# Ask Sivan 🔮

**Ask Sivan** is a playful Magic 8-Ball–style web app created as a farewell artifact for the Bill Pay team.

While Sivan is leaving Bill Pay, she wanted to leave behind the answers to all questions that are Bill Pay — from dependencies and KPIs to coffee and Happy Feet.

Shake the ball and see what wisdom you get.

## 💖 Notes

This project is intentionally lightweight, a little silly, and very much on brand.

Feel free to fork it, customize the phrases, or reuse the pattern for your own team.

Thanks for all the great questions, conversations, and laughs.
